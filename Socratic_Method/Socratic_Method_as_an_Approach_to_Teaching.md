- Soctraic method is based on Deweyan inquiry
- Socrates compares it to mid-wifery. A mid-wife helps a mother deliver a baby, whereas Socrates helps "students" deliver knowledge.
- Socratic method has 5 stages
  - Wonder (similar to doubt in Deweyan cycle)
  - Hypothesis
  - Elenchus : Refutation and cross-examination. This happens via 
    - counter-examples
    - self-contradiction (person believes $c$ but says $a$ and $b$, which imply $\sim c$, thus proving that either $c$ is false or one of $a,b$ is false.)
  - Acceptance or Rejection of Hypothesis
  - Action based on findings
- Classic Socratic Method
  - Used to discuss moral concepts such as justice, holiness, friendship, virtue, etc.
  - Only pumping and questioning is done. The questions aren't tailored to hint at expected KCs.
  - Mainly done so that the audience gives their views on topics. There is absolute truth here.
- Modern Socratic Method
  - This is used for delivering "absolute" knowledge.
  - Classical method is just identification and definition of concepts via concenseus.
  - Modern method involves teaching specific KCs.
