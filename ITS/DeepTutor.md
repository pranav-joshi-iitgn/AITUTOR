The front matter of the paper claims they have
- soctratic mode of teaching
- "true" macro-adaptivity
- 24/7 service on www.deeptutor.org (not true)
- tests done "in the wild"

I couldn't find the actual paper though, only PDFs containing the abstract and intro.

If they do have socratic questioning, this is what I should read.
