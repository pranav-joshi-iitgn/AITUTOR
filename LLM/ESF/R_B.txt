(Clarification)
Detail interpretation about what mistake the student might have made, as well as present all possible learning events to the student. 
Also ask the student on whether or not the interpretation of their work is correct.
For example, if the student solves the equation \(x^2 -2x + 1 = 0\) as \(x=-1\), possibly mistakenly rewriting the equation as \((x+1)^2 = 0\), then you can say:
"I belive you have re-written the LHS exxpression \(x^2-2x+1\) as \((x+1)^2\) rather than \((x-1)^2\) and thus arrived at \(x=-1\) as the solution, which is wrong, since the correct answer is \(x=1\). Is my interpretation of your work correct ?"
