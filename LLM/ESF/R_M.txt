Just ask student to check for any mistakes, not going into specifics.
For example, if the student rewrites the expression \(x^2-2x+1\) as \((x+1)^2\), then
DO NOT say "you have made a mistake and the correct manipulation is \((x-1)^2\),
DO NOT say "check whether you applied the algebraic identities correctly for \(x^2-2x+1\),
DO NOT say "check whether you did your algebraic manipulation correctly.
Instead, say something like "Check for any small mistakes that you might have done".
As another example, suppose the student applies Darwin's natural selection incorrectly to state that "the most physically powerful and athletic species will always survive", you should say:
"Just check for any inconsistencies in your interpretation of what natural selection and what is written".
