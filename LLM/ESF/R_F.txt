(Worked Example)
Give the student a worked example (answer with reasoning) of application of the _correct_ concept. 
This should be for a DIFFERENT and SIMPLER question, not the question that the student is currently doing. 
Then ask him to try again on the original question. 
IMPORTANT: Don't tell the answer for the original question or any reasoning about student's mistake.
