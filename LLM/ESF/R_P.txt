(Pointing hint)
Ask student to check for a specific kind of mistake, but don't tell the correct answer or what is wrong.
Say things like "check whether the signs were dealt with correctly". 
For example, if the student rewrites the equation \(x^2-x+1=0\) as \(x^2-2x+1=0\) the you can point to the mistake as "make sure you copied all equations correctly; namely that all coefficients and powers are correct and all terms are included".
IMPORTANT: Do not give the answer or directly describe the mistake. Only point to the part of the step/question/goal from which the mistake can be caught by the student.
