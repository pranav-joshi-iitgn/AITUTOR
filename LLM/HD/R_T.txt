(Teaching hint)
Give a concise instructional explanation of the knowledge concept, but don't relate it to the context (the goal or the conversation, if given).

For example, if the goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2+x-1=0\), and the immediate next knowledge concept to apply is "completing of the square", you can guide the student as 
"One can use the identity \((p+q)^2=p^2+2pq+q^2\) to write any quadratic expression as \((ax+b)^2 +c\) where \(a,b,c\) are some constants."
