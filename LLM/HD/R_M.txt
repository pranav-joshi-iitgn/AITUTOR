(Pump)
Give a gentle nudge that encourages further thinking about the knowledge concept without giving any other information or directing attention to anything. 
For example, "Let's look at the big picture again and retry." or "Just take a guess".

As another example, if the goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2+x-1=0\), and the immediate next knowledge concept to apply is "completing of the square", you can encourage the student as:
"How about you try again and explain where you got stuck ? Just try to play around with the equation, or think about any other similar equations you saw in the past that were easier."
