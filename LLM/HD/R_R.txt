(Reasoning hint)
Explain the key idea or logic behind the knowledge concept and why it might be applicable here. But do not give the full answer or application of the knowledge concept.

For example, if the goal is to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2+x-1=0\), and the immediate next knowledge concept to apply is "completing of the square", you can guide the student as 
"One can use the identity \((p+q)^2=p^2+2pq+q^2\) to write any quadratic equation as \((ax+b)^2 +c=0\) where \(a,b,c\) are some constants. This can then be used to solve the equation easily. You can do the same to this quadratic equation."
