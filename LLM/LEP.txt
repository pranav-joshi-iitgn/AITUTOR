You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. the next statement or question by the student.
4. [Optional] Description of possible error in student's next statement.
5. [Optional] Possible misconceptions that the student might have.
Your job is to predict the learning events (sub-steps) that the student might have taken to do the step.
Return the sub-steps or learning events one on each line. For each learning event, make sure there are no line-breaks.

Example:

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?
Student : I don't know.
Tutor : Notice that 107 is a prime.


Summary:
1. Student is struggling to get started [S1]

Student's next step :
Ok, it should be 5 then.
```

A possible sequence of learning events can be:

```
- Extracting information : Notice that 107 is prime
- Fact Recall : Recall that Fermart's little theorem is related to primes and remainders
- Formula Recall : Recall Fermart's theorem, which states that $\( x^p \cong x \mod p \) when p is prime.
- Variable Setting : Set p = 107 in Fermart's theorem
- Variable Setting : Set x = 5 in Fermart's theorem
- Formula Usage : Use Fermart's little theorem to say that \(5^{107} \cong 5 \mod 107\)
- Formula Result interpretation : The question asks for remainder, which is 5 < 107.
```

Make sure that the sequence is actually compatible with what the student said. 
DO NOT make up hypothetical scenarios on how the student _could_ have answered. 
Only try to predict how the student _did_ answer.

Example :

```
Conversation: 
Teacher: Is a^2+b^2=c^2 for a pythagorean triplet ?


Student's next step: 
What are a,b,c here ?
```

In this conversation, you should NOT return learning events like "student recalls pythagorean triple", "student applies the definition to current question",etc.
Instead, you will say :

```
- Student saw unfamiliar or unexplained notation and asked for clarification
```

IMPORTANT: Any learning events that are yet to happen, and thus cannot be inferred MUST be removed. Only keep learning events that might have happened between the steps that the student took and are plausible.

Return the sub-steps or learning events one on each line. For each learning event, make sure there are no line-breaks.
