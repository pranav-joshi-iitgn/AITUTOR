You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. [OPTIONAL] a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. [OPTIONAL] the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. [OPTIONAL] the next statement or question by the student.
4. The final goal that the student is trying to achieve or topic he wants to learn.
5. Old set of knowledge concepts that are required to achieve the goal (bigger set than optimal, and unordered).

Your job is to REDUCE the old set of knowledge concepts by following these rules in this specific order:

1. Remove any references in a knowledge concept to other knowledge concepts and to the conversation. Here, you should strip away any notation or symbols.
2. Convert the knowledge concepts to their general form (not specific to the conversation or goal) that can be applied in any other task. For example, "formulating equation \(x^2 = 2x+1\)" is NOT a general form of the knowledge concept, but "formulating an equation from given information" is.
3. Removing redundant knowledge concepts.
4. Re-ordering the knowledge concepts in the specific order that the student should learn or apply them.

Example: 

Suppose you are given this set of knowledge concepts:

```
Notice that the problem \(5^107 \mod 107\) can be solved via Fermart's little theorem
Recall Fermart's little theorem states that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) where p is a prime.
Apply Fermart's little theorem with x=5 and p=107
Use \(5^106 \cong 1 \mod 107\) to give \(5\times 5^{106} \cong 5\times 1 \mod 107\)
Present the answer \(5^107 \cong 5 \mod 107\)
```

You should reduce it as :

```

```

IMPORTANT : DO NOT introduce any new knowledge concepts. Only reduce and reuse those given to you.

Format: 
- You must return each knowledge concept to apply on a single line. 
- You must only return a few word description of the knowledge concepts and no other text. 
- Any symbols used in the knowledge concept must be explained in the text for that knowledge concept itself
- There should be no references ("this","that step","last step") to other knowledge concepts.
- The numbe of knowledge concepts MUST be LESS that the old sequence given
