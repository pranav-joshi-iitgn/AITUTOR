Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?
Student : This question is related to remainders.. so we can apply theorems like Fermart's little theorem. It says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\).. x must be 5 .. but what is p?.
Tutor : Good. Notice that 107 is a prime.

Summary:
1. Student recognises that the problem might involve using number theoretic theorems like Fermart's little theorem. [S1]
2. Fermart's theorem says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) [S1].
3. x in Fermart's theorem is 5 in this case [S1].
4. Student doesn't know what is p (in Fermart's theorem) in this case.

Student's next step :
Ok, it should be 1 then.

Possible learning events:
- Extracting information : Notice that 107 is prime
- Variable Setting : Set p = 107 in Fermart's theorem
- Formula Usage : Using Fermart's little theorem incorrectly to say that \(5^{107} \cong 1 \mod 107\)
- Formula Result interpretation : The question asks for remainder, which is incorrectly reported as 1 (<107).

Error Description:
The student didn't compute exponent in Fermart's little theorem correctly.

Feedback Description: (Socratic Nudge)
IMPORTANT: Don't give the answer. 
Find prepositions A,B that student made earlier from which the falsity of the step S follows and present the prepositions A,B without any reasoning on how not-S follows. 
For example, if student claims (S) "Space shuttles need force to keed going" but also claims (A) "things stop because of friction" and (B) "there is not friction in space", then you only need to remind him that he said A and B and say nothing about S. 
I repeat, DO NOT give the answer. 
IMPORTANT: If a Socratic nudge is not possible, then just give a worked example type hint.
IMPORTANT: DO NOT make up prepositions that the student never claimed.
```

To this, you might give feedback as 

```
You said that Fermart's little theorem states that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p \) and that here x is 5.
You also seem to have concluded that p = 107. 
I have understood all this.

But then you said that the remainder of \(5^107\) divided by 107 is 1.
```


If instead, you have gotten this feedback description :

```
Feedback Description: (Socratic question)
Questions the student by presenting a counter-example, or by finding prepositions A,B from which falsity of new step S follows, and deriving not-S. 
But don't tell the correct answer.
```

then you would say something like 

```
You said that Fermart's little theorem states that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p \) and that here x is 5.
You also seem to have concluded that p = 107. 
From this we can say that \(5^106 \cong 1 \mod 107 \implies 5^107 \cong 5 \mod 107\).

But you also said that the remainder of \(5^107\) divided by 107 is 1 (your current answer), which is to say that \(5^{107} \cong 1 \mod 107\).
There seems to be inconsistency in your statements.
```

Again, if the feedback description was 

```
Feedback Description : (Worked Example) 
Give the student a worked example (answer with reasoning) of application of the _correct_ concept. 
This should be for a DIFFERENT and SIMPLER question, not the question that the student is currently doing. 
Then ask him to try again on the original question. 
IMPORTANT: Don't tell the answer for the original question or any reasoning about student's mistake.
```

you might generate something like

```
Let's re-examine it. 
Here's an example:
Suppose you had x = 2 and p = 5 in Fermart's little theorem, then you would have \(2^{5-1} = 2^4 \cong 1 \mod 5\) and thus \(2^5 \cong 2\times 1 = 2 \mod p\).
Now, let's try again.
