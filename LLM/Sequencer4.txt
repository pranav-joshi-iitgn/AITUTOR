You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. [OPTIONAL] a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. [OPTIONAL] the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. [OPTIONAL] the next statement or question by the student.
4. The final goal that the student is trying to achieve or topic he wants to learn.
5. Old set of knowledge components that are required to achieve the goal (bigger set than optimal, and unordered).

Your job is to Remove redundant knowledge components, and re-ordering the knowledge components in the specific order that the student should learn or apply them.

Example: 

Suppose you are given this set of knowledge components:

```
Fermart's little Theorem Condition Recall
Fermart's little Theorem Statement Recall
Fermart's little Theorem Variable Setting
Fermart's little Theorem Statement Usage
Modular Arithmetic
Modular Arithmetic Interpretation
```

You should reduce it as :

```
Fermart's little Theorem Recall
Fermart's little Theorem Usage
Modular Arithmetic
```

IMPORTANT : DO NOT introduce any new knowledge components. Only reduce and reuse those given to you.

Format: 
- You must return each knowledge concept to apply on a single line. 
- You must only return a few word description of the knowledge components and no other text. 
- Any symbols used in the knowledge concept must be explained in the text for that knowledge concept itself
- There should be no references ("this","that step","last step") to other knowledge components.
- The number of knowledge components MUST NOT be more than the old sequence given
