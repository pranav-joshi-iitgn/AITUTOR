**Bottom‑out hint**

To apply proof by contradiction, start by assuming the opposite of the statement you want to prove. For example, if you must show “Statement S is true,” write “Assume **¬S**.” Then work logically from this assumption to reach a contradiction—an impossible conclusion such as both a proposition and its negation, or a mathematical impossibility (e.g., a negative number equals a square root of a positive number). Once that contradiction is obtained, you can conclude that the original statement **S** must be true.
----------
To prove a statement \(P\) by contradiction, first assume the opposite: “\(P\) is false.” From this assumption work only with logical deductions and known facts. Keep an eye out for any conclusion that is impossible—such as a statement that is known to be false, or a situation where you deduce both a proposition and its negation. When you find such an impossible conclusion, you have reached a contradiction, which shows that the assumption “\(P\) is false” cannot hold. Therefore \(P\) must be true.
----------
A proof by contradiction starts by assuming the opposite (negation) of the statement you want to prove.  Then you deduce, using valid logical steps, an impossible or contradictory fact (e.g., both a proposition and its negation).  Because the assumption leads to a contradiction, the original statement must be true.
----------
In a proof by contradiction, you begin by assuming that **the statement you want to prove is false**.  
What would that assumption look like for the proposition at hand?
----------
Think back to the section where you first **assumed** that the statement you want to prove is false. That assumption is the key starting point for a proof by contradiction.

Student is confused and hasn't started a specific plan; they are waiting for the tutor to clarify how to use proof by contradiction to show √2 is irrational.
It sounds like you’re feeling a bit stuck on how to begin the proof‑by‑contradiction argument.  
Could you tell me what your current plan is? For instance:

- Do you plan to **assume** that √2 is rational (i.e., that it can be written as a fraction a/b in lowest terms)?
- Then what do you think you’ll do next—multiply both sides by b, square both sides, simplify, etc.?

Let me know where you’re at, and I’ll help you connect those steps to the proof‑by‑contradiction framework. In the meantime, I’ll say that you’ve identified the right high‑level goal (prove √2 is irrational) and the correct technique (proof by contradiction), so we’re on the right track—just need to map out the specific steps.
> Ok.. I mean I didn't really say anything. But let's go with proof by contradiction. Let's assume root 2 is rational. Then we'll try to conclude impossibility of it happening.

Plan:  
- Assume √2 can be written as a rational number a/b in lowest terms.  
- From this assumption, set up the equation √2 = a/b, square both sides, and simplify to obtain an equation relating a and b.  
- Use the derived equation to show that both a and b must share a common factor (e.g., both are even), contradicting the assumption that a/b was in lowest terms.  
- Conclude that the original assumption that √2 is rational is impossible, thus proving √2 is irrational.

----------
To make the contradiction explicit, follow this next step:

1. Square the assumption √2 = a/b (with a and b coprime).  
   → 2 = a²/b².  
2. Multiply both sides by b² to clear the denominator.  
   → 2b² = a².

Because a² equals 2 times a square (2b²), a² must be an even number. An even square can only come from an even integer, so a itself is even; write a = 2k for some integer k. Substituting a = 2k back into 2b² = a² gives

 2b² = (2k)² = 4k²  
 → b² = 2k²,

which shows that b² is also even, hence b is even. Thus both a and b are divisible by 2, contradicting the assumption that a/b was in lowest terms. Conclude that the original assumption that √2 is rational is impossible, proving √2 is irrational.
----------
Recall that in a proof‑by‑contradiction you first **assume the opposite** of what you want to prove, then show that this assumption forces an impossible situation.  

Here, start by letting √2 = a/b with a and b in lowest terms.  From this assumption square both sides, simplify, and look for a property of a and b that cannot hold if they are coprime (e.g., that they share a common divisor).  Finding such a property will be the contradiction that ends the argument.
----------
Proof‑by‑contradiction: Start by **assuming** the statement you want to prove is false. Work out the logical consequences of that assumption. If these consequences lead to an impossibility—such as a known fact that is false, or a contradiction like a number being both even and odd—then the assumption must be wrong. Conclude that the original statement is true. This method relies on the principle that a true proposition cannot lead to a logical contradiction.
----------
After squaring both sides, you obtain the equation  

**2 b² = a²**.  

What can you infer about the factorization (parity) of *a* from this equality?
----------
Remember the equation you reached after squaring the assumption √2 = a/b—namely the relationship that ties the integers a and b together. That relationship is the key point where a contradiction should appear.
----------
Take a moment to step back and think about the overall strategy you want to employ.

----------
To apply the idea that a rational number must be written as a fraction of coprime integers, follow this one key step:

**Square the equation √2 = a/b** to obtain  
  2 = a²/b² ⇒ 2b² = a².

Now notice that the right‑hand side a² is even, so a itself must be even. (Let a = 2k.) Substitute this into the equation to get b² = 2k², which shows b is also even. Thus a and b share the factor 2, contradicting the assumption that they were coprime. This contradiction proves that √2 cannot be rational.
----------
Remember that in a *lowest‑terms* fraction the two integers a and b share no common divisor other than 1.  
When you set √2 = a/b, squaring gives 2b² = a².  
Because the right side is a perfect square, it must be even, so a is even.  
Write a = 2k; then 2b² = 4k², so b² = 2k², forcing b to be even as well.  
Thus both a and b are divisible by 2, contradicting that they were coprime.  
The contradiction comes from the assumption that a/b was already in simplest form.
----------
A rational number is a number that can be written as a fraction a ⁄ b, where a and b are integers and b ≠ 0.  
When we say the fraction is in *lowest terms* we mean that the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1; in other words, a and b share no common factor other than 1.  

Any rational number can be expressed in this form: start with any fraction, compute the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator, and divide both by that divisor. The resulting fraction is the unique lowest‑term representation of that rational number.
----------
Because \(a/b\) is in lowest terms, the only positive integer that divides both \(a\) and \(b\) is __________.
----------
Think back to your assumption that **a** and **b** are coprime.  
What does that tell you about any common factor (e.g., 2) that might appear in the equation you get after squaring?  (Consider how the equation forces **a** to be divisible by 2 and what that implies for **b**.)
----------
Think about what it means for a fraction to be in lowest terms—how would that affect any relationships you derive between the numerator and denominator?

> Ok.. I get it. You can always write the numerator and denominator as coprimes. So the hypothesis is that root 2 = a/b where a,b are coprime. Now, we need to prove that this can't happen.

1. Assume \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime integers.

3. Multiply by \(b^2\) to obtain \(2b^2 = a^2\).

E=Divisibility property: if a prime divides a square, it divides the integer
good= False
HS =
----------
To apply the divisibility property, the tutor should point out that the prime in question is 2.  
Explain that if 2 divides the square \(a^{2}\), then every prime factor of \(a^{2}\) appears in the factorization of \(a\) as well. Since \(a^{2}\) contains the factor \(2\) twice, \(a\) must contain at least one factor of 2; in other words, \(a\) is even. This gives the missing step: “Because \(2b^{2}=a^{2}\) and 2 divides the left side, 2 must divide the right side \(a^{2}\); therefore 2 divides \(a\).”
----------
When a prime number appears as a factor of a perfect square, it must already divide the base integer.  
For example, if a prime p satisfies p | n², then p | n.  
Use this idea on the equation 2 b² = a²: 2 divides a², so 2 must divide a, letting you write a = 2k.
----------
If a prime number \(p\) divides the square of an integer \(n\) (i.e., \(p \mid n^{2}\)), then \(p\) must also divide \(n\) itself.  
In other words, if \(n^{2}\) is a multiple of a prime \(p\), then \(n\) is a multiple of \(p\).  
For example, if \(2 \mid (3k)^{2}\), then \(2\) must divide \(3k\), so \(2\) divides \(k\).
----------
If 2 divides \(a^{2}\) (write \(2\mid a^{2}\)), then by the divisibility property a prime divisor of a square must divide the base.  
**Prompt:** “From \(2\mid a^{2}\), we can conclude \(2\mid\ \square\). What integer fills the blank?”
----------
Recall that in the equation  

  \(2\,b^{2}=a^{2}\),

the factor \(2\) (which is a prime) divides the right‑hand side \(a^{2}\).  
Consider what the divisibility rule for primes says about the integer \(a\) itself.
----------
Think about how the prime number 2 interacts with the equations you’ve written. What does its presence tell you about the numbers that appear on each side of the equation?

Student intends to start from the assumption \( \sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}\) (with \(a,b\) coprime).  
They have rewritten this as \(a=b\sqrt{2}\) and plan to square both sides to obtain  
\(a^{2}=2b^{2}\).  
From this equation they aim to use the divisibility property (“if a prime divides a square, it divides the integer”) to deduce that \(2\mid a\), set \(a=2k\), substitute back, and eventually show that \(2\mid b\) as well—contradicting the assumption that \(a/b\) is in lowest terms and thereby proving \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.

SED = The student is stuck and does not progress beyond setting \(a = b\sqrt{2}\).
HS=
----------
From the equation \(a^{2}=2b^{2}\) notice that the prime \(2\) divides the left‑hand side.  
By the divisibility property, if a prime divides a square it must divide the base: hence \(2 \mid a\).  
Write \(a=2k\) for some integer \(k\).  Then substitute back:  
\((2k)^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Rightarrow\;4k^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Rightarrow\;2k^{2}=b^{2}\).  
Now the same reasoning shows \(2 \mid b\), contradicting the assumption that \(a/b\) is in lowest terms.
----------
Consider the equation \(a^{2}=2\,b^{2}\).  
Because the prime number 2 appears on the right‑hand side, \(a^{2}\) is divisible by 2.  
Recall the fact: **if a prime divides a square, it divides the base integer**.  
So from \(2\mid a^{2}\) you can infer that \(2\mid a\).  
This observation is the first step toward showing that \(b\) is also even, leading to the contradiction.
----------
**Key idea:**  
If a prime number \(p\) divides the square of an integer \(x^2\), then \(p\) must also divide the integer \(x\) itself. In other words, whenever a prime factor appears in the factorization of a perfect square, it appears at least once in the factorization of the base integer. This property is often used to show that a prime cannot divide a square without also dividing its root.
----------
Because \(2\) divides the left side \(a^{2}\), the divisibility property tells us that \(2\) must also divide \(a\). What substitution can you make for \(a\) now?
----------
Think back to the equation you derived from \(a=b\sqrt{2}\) – the one where you square both sides.  In that equation the prime number 2 appears on the right‑hand side.  Consider what the presence of 2 on that side tells you about the left‑hand side, specifically about the prime‑divisibility of the square that shows up there.
