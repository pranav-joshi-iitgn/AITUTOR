**Proof that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational (≤ 5 steps)**  

1. **Assume the contrary.**  
   Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational. Then we can write it in lowest terms as  
   \[
   \sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b},
   \]
   where \(a,b\in\mathbb Z\), \(b\neq0\), and \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).

2. **Eliminate the square root.**  
   Square both sides:  
   \[
   2 = \frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\;\Longrightarrow\; a^{2}=2b^{2}.
   \]

3. **Show \(a\) must be even.**  
   The equation \(a^{2}=2b^{2}\) implies that \(a^{2}\) is even (since the right‑hand side is even).  
   The square of an odd integer is odd, so \(a\) cannot be odd. Hence \(a\) is even: \(a=2k\) for some integer \(k\).

4. **Deduce \(b\) is also even.**  
   Substitute \(a=2k\) into \(a^{2}=2b^{2}\):  
   \[
   (2k)^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;4k^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;2k^{2}=b^{2}.
   \]
   Thus \(b^{2}\) is even, and consequently \(b\) is even.

5. **Contradiction.**  
   We have shown both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, meaning they share a common factor of \(2\).  
   This contradicts the assumption that \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).  
   Therefore the assumption that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational is false; \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.

H=If you want to prove that √2 is irrational, a useful approach is to start with a **proof by contradiction**. Think about the sentence: “Suppose √2 is rational.”  What does that give you in terms of a fraction a/b with integers a,b and b≠0?  Consider what happens when you square that fraction and compare it to 2 — what kind of relationship between a and b would arise, and why might that lead to an impossibility?

H=You’ve already removed the radical by squaring the fraction \( \sqrt{2}=a/b \), which gives the equation you wrote down:  

\(a^{2}=2\,b^{2}\).  

Notice that squaring a fraction eliminates the square root, so the left‑hand side is now a perfect square of an integer, and the right‑hand side is twice a perfect square.  Consider what this tells you about how \(a\) and \(b\) must relate to one another.
