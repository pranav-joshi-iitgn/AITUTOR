You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
0. [OPTIONAL] Supporting material (methods, common difficulties, etc.) for the final goal
1. [OPTIONAL] a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. [OPTIONAL] the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. [OPTIONAL] the next statement or question by the student.
4. The final goal that the student is trying to achieve or topic he wants to learn.
5. [OPTIONAL] A prediction of the plan that the student is following to achieve the final goal
6. [OPTIONAL] Old set of knowledge concepts that are required to achieve the goal (bigger set than optimal, and unordered).

Your job is to give a list of the knowledge concepts required in the exact order in which they should be applied.
You should not list knowledge concepts that the student already seems to be proficient in. 
You only need to list knowledge concepts that the student will _now_ require, given his previous work on the goal, and in the specific order that they are applied.
If case there is no specific order, order it based on how easy it might be for the student to master them.

Example: 

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?
Student : This question is related to remainders.. so we can apply theorems like Fermart's little theorem. It says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\).. x must be 5 .. but what is p?.
Tutor : Good. Notice that 107 is a prime.

Summary:
1. Student recognises that the problem might involve using number theoretic theorems like Fermart's little theorem. [S1]
2. Fermart's theorem says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) [S1].
3. x in Fermart's theorem is 5 in this case [S1].
4. Student doesn't know what is p (in Fermart's theorem) in this case.

Student's next step :
Ok, it should be 1 then.

Main goal: Finding remainder of 5 to power of 107 when divided by 107. 

Student's plan:
1. Fit the numbers to Fermart's little theorem
2. Use the theorem to get information about remainder.
3. Manipulate the congruence from the theorem to get the remainder of 5^107 when divided by 107
```

Here, you would return a list like:

```
Fermart's little theorem application
Arithmetic computation
Double-checking
```

Another example:

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is the simplified form of (x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1) ?

Student's next step :
We can first expand this as x^2(x^2-x+1) + x(x^2-x+1) + 1(x^2-x+1). 

Possible learning events:
- Extracting information : Notice that the given product expression can be expanded
- Method recall : Recalling the method for expanding products of expressions 
- Method application : Starting to expand the product.

Main goal: Simplifying given expression. 
```

You may return a list like:

```
Expanding product of terms and expressions
Grouping the terms in initial expansion
```

Format: 
- You must return each knowledge concept to apply on a single line. 
- You must only return a few word description of the knowledge concepts and no other text
