You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. The final goal that the student is trying to achieve or topic he wants to learn.
2. Old set of knowledge components that are required to achieve the goal (bigger set than optimal, and unordered).

Your job is to convert the knowledge components to their general form (not specific to the conversation or goal) that can be applied in any other task. For example, "formulating equation \(x^2 = 2x+1\)" is NOT a general form of the knowledge concept, but "formulating an equation from given information" is.
If the knowledge component is too specific and doesn't make sense without context, then you can remove it from the sequence.

For example, suppose you are given this set of knowledge components:

```
Notice that the problem \(5^107 \mod 107\) can be solved via Fermart's little theorem
Recall Fermart's little theorem states that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) where p is a prime.
Apply Fermart's little theorem with x=5 and p=107
Use \(5^106 \cong 1 \mod 107\) to give \(5\times 5^{106} \cong 5\times 1 \mod 107\)
Present the answer \(5^107 \cong 5 \mod 107\) as the remainder
```

You should reduce it as :

```
Fermart's little Theorem Condition Recall
Fermart's little Theorem Statement Recall
Fermart's little Theorem Variable Setting
Fermart's little Theorem Statement Usage
Modular Arithmetic
```

IMPORTANT : DO NOT introduce any new knowledge components. Only reduce and reuse those given to you.

Format: 
- You must return each knowledge concept to apply on a single line. 
- You must only return a few word description of the knowledge components and no other text. 
- Any symbols used in the knowledge concept must be explained in the text for that knowledge concept itself
- There should be no references ("this","that step","last step") to other knowledge components.
- The number of knowledge components MUST be LESS or EQUAL to that in the old sequence given
