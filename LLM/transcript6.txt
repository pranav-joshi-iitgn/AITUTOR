H=Here’s a quick illustration with a slightly simpler irrationality proof—showing that \(\sqrt{3}\) cannot be expressed as a fraction in lowest terms.

---

### Worked Example: \(\sqrt{3}\) is Irrational

**Assume** \(\sqrt{3}\) can be written as a fraction \(\displaystyle \frac{a}{b}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers that are coprime (\(\gcd(a,b)=1\)).

1. **Square both sides**  
   \[
   3 = \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{2} \;\Longrightarrow\; 3b^{2} = a^{2}.
   \]

2. **Look at prime factorizations**  
   The left–hand side has a factor of \(3\) that appears **once** (an odd number of times).  
   Therefore, the right–hand side, \(a^{2}\), must also contain a factor of \(3\) that appears an odd number of times.

3. **Consequences for \(a\)**  
   Since \(a^{2}\) has an odd number of factors of \(3\), the integer \(a\) itself must contain at least one factor of \(3\); in fact, \(a\) must be a multiple of \(3\).

4. **Plug that back in**  
   If \(a\) is divisible by \(3\), then \(a^{2}\) is divisible by \(9\).  
   But the equation \(3b^{2}=a^{2}\) shows that \(a^{2}\) is only divisible by \(3\), not by \(9\), unless \(b\) is also divisible by \(3\).

5. **Contradiction with \(\gcd(a,b)=1\)**  
   The reasoning forces both \(a\) and \(b\) to be divisible by \(3\), which contradicts our initial assumption that \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).

Hence the assumption that \(\sqrt{3}\) can be written as a fraction in lowest terms leads to a contradiction; therefore \(\sqrt{3}\) is irrational.

---

Now, try applying the same idea to the original problem about \(\sqrt{2}\). Think about why the condition \(\gcd(a,b)=1\) is crucial in reaching a contradiction. Good luck!

H=### Worked Example: Proving \(\sqrt{5}\) is Irrational  

**Assume** \(\sqrt{5}\) can be written as a fraction in lowest terms  
\[
\sqrt{5}=\frac{a}{b},
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers with \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).

1. **Square both sides**  
   \[
   5=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;5\,b^{2}=a^{2}.
   \]

2. **Look at the prime factor \(5\)**  
   In the product \(5\,b^{2}\), the prime \(5\) appears exactly once (an odd number of times).

3. **Consequences for \(a^{2}\)**  
   Since \(a^{2}\) equals \(5\,b^{2}\), the prime \(5\) must also appear an odd number of times in the factorization of \(a^{2}\).  
   For a square \(a^{2}\), every prime factor appears an even number of times. The only way to reconcile this is if the prime \(5\) is *also* a factor of \(a\); in fact, \(a\) must be divisible by \(5\).

4. **Substitute back**  
   Write \(a=5k\) for some integer \(k\).  
   Then \(a^{2}=25k^{2}\), so the equation \(5\,b^{2}=a^{2}\) becomes
   \[
   5\,b^{2}=25k^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;b^{2}=5k^{2}.
   \]
   Now the prime \(5\) again appears exactly once on the right–hand side, so \(b\) must also be divisible by \(5\).

5. **Contradiction with \(\gcd(a,b)=1\)**  
   We have shown that both \(a\) and \(b\) are divisible by \(5\), contradicting the assumption that \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).

Hence our initial assumption must be false: \(\sqrt{5}\) cannot be expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, so \(\sqrt{5}\) is irrational.

> Yes.. what about it ?
instr=2
The key fact to use is: **if a prime \(p\) divides a perfect square \(n^2\), then \(p\) divides \(n\)**.

Here the prime is \(p=2\).  
From the equation \(a^{2}=2b^{2}\) we see that \(2\) divides the left‑hand side \(a^{2}\).  
Hence, by the prime‑divisibility property, **\(2\) must divide \(a\)**.  

So we can write  
\[
a = 2k \quad\text{for some integer }k.
\]

Now substitute this into the original equation:

\[
(2k)^{2} = 2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;4k^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;2k^{2}=b^{2}.
\]

This shows that \(b^{2}\) is even, and therefore \(b\) itself is even.  

Thus both \(a\) and \(b\) are divisible by \(2\), contradicting the assumption that \(\frac{a}{b}\) was in lowest terms (i.e., \(\gcd(a,b)=1\)).  

That is the step that completes the argument.
