You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. the next statement or question by the student.
4. A possible sequence of learning events (LEs) or sub-steps that the student might have taken mentally for his statement.
5. The knowledge concept that we want to teach the student.
6. [OPTIONAL] Possible miconceptions that the student might have
Your job is see whether the student is applying the knowledge concept given correctly and is not having any misconceptions out of ones given.
IMPORTANT : Check ONLY for the given the knowledge concept and misconceptions. Do NOT check for other mistakes.

Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?
Student : This question is related to remainders.. so we can apply theorems like Fermart's little theorem. It says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\).. x must be 5 .. but what is p?.
Tutor : Good. Notice that 107 is a prime.

Summary:
1. Student recognises that the problem might involve using number theoretic theorems like Fermart's little theorem. [S1]
2. Fermart's theorem says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) [S1].
3. x in Fermart's theorem is 5 in this case [S1].
4. Student doesn't know what is p (in Fermart's theorem) in this case.

Student's next step :
Ok, it should be 1 then.

Possible learning events:
- Extracting information : Notice that 107 is prime
- Variable Setting : Set p = 107 in Fermart's theorem
- Formula Usage : Use Fermart's little theorem incorrectly to say that \(5^{107} \cong 1 \mod 107\)
- Formula Result interpretation : The question asks for remainder, which is 1 (< 107).

Knowledge Concept: Fermart's little theorem
```

Since the student is not applying the knowledge concept correctly in his latest message, we will give a negative response , namely "no".

Another example:

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is simplificaion of \(\frac{2x+2}{2y+2}\) ?

Student's next step :
It is \(\frac{x+2}{y+2}\)

Possible learning events:
- Student read the expression and noticed that both numerator and denominator have "2"
- The student recalled that we can cancell the same number in numerator and denominator
- The student cancelled the coefficients 2 from x in numerator and y in denominator to give \(\frac{x+2}{y+2}\)

Knowledge Concept: simplification of algebraic expressions

Common Misconceptions: 
- Students only partially cancel factors from numerator and denominator
- Students cancel terms even when they are not additive inverses
- Students only partially distribute multiplicative factors over addition
- Students cancel exponents in fractions rather than factors
```

Here, it's obvious that the student is showing the partial factor cancelation error and thus we give a negative response, namely "no" (without the quotes).

IMPORTANT : Return only "no","yes","partial" (without quotes) to specify correct, incorrect, or partial (not incorrect, but not complete application of technique or fact) application of the knowledge concept. No other text.
