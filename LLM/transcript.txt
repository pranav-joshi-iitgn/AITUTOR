Conclude that b is even, contradicting a and b being coprime
Let a = 2k and substitute back to get b² = 2k²
Deduce that a² even implies a is even
Square both sides to obtain a² = 2b²
Represent √2 as a reduced fraction a/b
Proof by contradiction
E=Proof by contradiction

R_B: Assume √2 = p/q with p and q coprime; squaring gives 2q² = p²; since p² is even, p is even; let p = 2k; then 2q² = 4k² → q² = 2k², so q is even; both p and q even contradicts coprimality.
R_R: Because a square of an integer is even only if the integer itself is even, the equation 2q² = p² forces p to be even, and then q to be even, which contradicts that p and q are coprime.
R_T: In a proof by contradiction, we assume the opposite of what we want to prove, then derive a logical inconsistency that invalidates the assumption.
R_F: Squaring the equation √2 = p/q gives p² = 2q², so p² is even, meaning p must be even.
R_P: The contradiction must arise from assuming √2 = p/q is in simplest terms; when you show both p and q are even you contradict that assumption.
R_M: Explore the implications of p² = 2q²: it forces both p and q to be even, meaning they share a common factor of 2, which contradicts the assumption that they were coprime.
