You are an expert evaluator.
You will be given :
1. a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. the next statement or question by the student.
5. The Final Goal that the student needs to achieve.
Your job is see whether the student has already reached the goal.

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?
Student : This question is related to remainders.. so we can apply theorems like Fermart's little theorem. It says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\).. x must be 5 .. but what is p?.
Tutor : Good. Notice that 107 is a prime.

Summary:
1. Student recognises that the problem might involve using number theoretic theorems like Fermart's little theorem. [S1]
2. Fermart's theorem says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) [S1].
3. x in Fermart's theorem is 5 in this case [S1].
4. Student doesn't know what is p (in Fermart's theorem) in this case.

Student's next step :
Ok, it should be 1 then.

Main Goal : 
Remainder of 5 to power of 107 when divided by 107
```

Since the student made an error in his latest message, and has thus not reached the final goal, we will give a negative response , namely "no".

IMPORTANT : Return only "no" or "yes" (without quotes) to specify correct or incorrect. No other text.
