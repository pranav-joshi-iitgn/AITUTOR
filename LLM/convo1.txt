Let’s review the overall idea again and explore what else can be uncovered.
> I don't get it...
It sounds like you’re feeling a bit stuck on how to begin the proof‑by‑contradiction argument.  
Could you tell me what your current plan is? For instance:

- Do you plan to **assume** that √2 is rational (i.e., that it can be written as a fraction a/b in lowest terms)?
- Then what do you think you’ll do next—multiply both sides by b, square both sides, simplify, etc.?

Let me know where you’re at, and I’ll help you connect those steps to the proof‑by‑contradiction framework. In the meantime, I’ll say that you’ve identified the right high‑level goal (prove √2 is irrational) and the correct technique (proof by contradiction), so we’re on the right track—just need to map out the specific steps.
> Ok.. I mean I didn't really say anything. But let's go with proof by contradiction. Let's assume root 2 is rational. Then we'll try to conclude impossibility of it happening.
Think about what it means for a fraction to be in lowest terms—how would that affect any relationships you derive between the numerator and denominator?
> Ok.. I get it. You can always write the numerator and denominator as coprimes. So the hypothesis is that root 2 = a/b where a,b are coprime. Now, we need to prove that this can't happen.        
Think about how the prime number 2 interacts with the equations you’ve written. What does its presence tell you about the numbers that appear on each side of the equation?
> a = b root 2 .. so if b is an integer .. then .. i don't know how to proceed..
Let's try again. Think back to the equation you derived from \(a=b\sqrt{2}\) – the one where you square both sides.  In that equation the prime number 2 appears on the right‑hand side.  Consider what the presence of 2 on that side tells you about the left‑hand side, specifically about the prime‑divisibility of the square that shows up there.
