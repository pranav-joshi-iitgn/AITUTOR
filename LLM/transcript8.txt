**Proof that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational**

1. **Assume the contrary**:  
   Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational. Then it can be written as a fraction in lowest terms,  
   \[
   \sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}\qquad(a,b\in\mathbb Z,\; \gcd(a,b)=1,\;b\neq0).
   \]

2. **Square both sides**:  
   \[
   2=\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad a^{2}=2b^{2}.
   \]
   Thus \(a^{2}\) is even.

3. **Conclude \(a\) is even**:  
   If a square is even, its base must be even.  
   Write \(a=2k\) for some integer \(k\).  
   Substitute back: \((2k)^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;4k^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;2k^{2}=b^{2}\).

4. **Conclude \(b\) is even**:  
   The equation \(b^{2}=2k^{2}\) shows \(b^{2}\) is even, so \(b\) must be even.

5. **Reach a contradiction**:  
   Both \(a\) and \(b\) are divisible by 2, contradicting \(\gcd(a,b)=1\).  
   Hence the assumption that \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational is false; therefore \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.

What does that rule imply about the relationship between \(2\) and \(p\) in this case?

- The student claims that if the prime 2 divides p, then p = 2k for some integer k.  
- The student derives that substituting p = 2k into p² = 2q² gives 4k² = 2q², hence q² = 2k², so 2 divides q.
