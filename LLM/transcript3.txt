Contradiction of coprimality when both a and b are divisible by the same prime
Proof by contradiction technique
Prime divisibility: if p is prime and p divides a² then p divides a
Coprime integers definition (a and b share no common divisor)
Rational number as reduced fraction a/b (a,b integers, b≠0)
E=Rational number as reduced fraction a/b (a,b integers, b≠0)
H=
