**Proof that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational**

1. **Assume the contrary**  
   Suppose \(\sqrt{2}\) is rational. Then there exist coprime integers \(a,b\neq0\) such that  
   \[
   \sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad 2=\frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}\;\Longrightarrow\; a^{2}=2b^{2}.
   \]

2. **Deduce divisibility of \(a\)**  
   The equation \(a^{2}=2b^{2}\) shows that \(a^{2}\) is even.  
   If a square is even, its base must be even; thus \(a\) is even.  
   Write \(a=2k\) for some integer \(k\).

3. **Substitute back and find \(b\) even**  
   Plug \(a=2k\) into \(a^{2}=2b^{2}\):
   \[
   (2k)^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;4k^{2}=2b^{2}\;\Longrightarrow\;2k^{2}=b^{2}.
   \]
   Hence \(b^{2}\) is even, so \(b\) is even as well.

4. **Contradiction of coprimality**  
   Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, meaning they have a common factor of \(2\).  
   This contradicts the assumption that \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime.

5. **Conclusion**  
   The contradiction shows that our initial assumption is false.  
   Therefore, \(\sqrt{2}\) cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers; it is irrational.

# Now, these steps are for sure what we would want to hint on.. but these aren't knowledge components..

H=If you assume that √2 is rational, what does that assumption say about its form? Recall the definition of a rational number: a number that can be written as a fraction \(p/q\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers with \(q\neq 0\). How would √2 fit into that definition?

- √2 can be expressed as a fraction p/q where q ≠ 0. 
- (Implied) p and q are integers, so √2 satisfies the definition of a rational number.

1. Recall the definition of a rational number as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0.  
2. Assume √2 can be expressed in that form.  
3. Consider the implications of p and q being integers in lowest terms.

H=**Worked example (different, simpler question)**  
Let’s look at a very basic rational number:  

\[
\frac{4}{7}
\]

According to the definition, a rational number can be written as a fraction \(p/q\) where  

- \(p\) and \(q\) are **integers**, and  
- \(q \neq 0\).

For \(\frac{4}{7}\):  
- The numerator \(p = 4\) is an integer.  
- The denominator \(q = 7\) is an integer and is not zero.  

Thus \(\frac{4}{7}\) satisfies the definition of a rational number, so it is indeed rational.

Now that we’ve seen a concrete example, try applying the same reasoning to the original question.
