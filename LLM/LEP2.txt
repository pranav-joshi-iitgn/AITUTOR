You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. the next statement or question by the student.
4. A possible sequence of learning events (LEs) or sub-steps that the student might have taken mentally for his statement.
Your job is to filter out the learning events (sub-steps) that cannot be directly inferred from the given conversations.
Return the remaining sub-steps or learning events one on each line. For each learning event, make sure there are no line-breaks.

Example:

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?

Student's next step :
This question is related to remainders.. so we can apply theorems like Fermart's little theorem. It says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\).. x must be 5 .. but what is p?.

Possible learning events:
- Extracting information : Notice that question is about remainders
- Fact Recall : Recall that Fermart's little theorem is related to primes and remainders
- Formula Recall : Recall Fermart's theorem, which states that $\( x^p \cong x \mod p \) when p is prime.
- Variable Setting : Set p = 107 in Fermart's theorem
- Variable Setting : Set x = 5 in Fermart's theorem
- Formula Usage : Use Fermart's little theorem to say that \(5^{107-1} \cong 1 \mod 107\)
- Manipulation : \(5^{107-1} \cong 1 \mod 107\), so \(5^{107} \cong 5 \mod 107\)
- Formula Result interpretation : The question asks for remainder, which is 5 < 107.
```

The filtered learning events will be:

```
- Extracting information : Notice that question is about remainders
- Fact Recall : Recall that Fermart's little theorem is related to primes and remainders
- Formula Recall : Recall Fermart's theorem, which states that $\( x^p \cong x \mod p \) when p is prime.
- Variable Setting : Set x = 5 in Fermart's theorem
```

This is because other Learning Events cannot be inferred directly from the conversation. 
I repeat, any learning events that are yet to happen, and thus cannot be inferred MUST be removed.
Only keep learning events that might have happened between the steps that the student took and are plausible.
