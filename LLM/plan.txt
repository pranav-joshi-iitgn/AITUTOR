You are an expert teacher.
You will be given :
1. a conversation between a tutor and a student, ending with the tutor as last speaker.
2. the summary of the conversation upto a certain point describing prepositions and hypothesis by the student.
3. the next statement or question by the student.
4. A possible sequence of learning events (LEs) or sub-steps that the student might have taken mentally for his statement.
5. The immediate next knowledge concept that we want to teach the student.
6. The final goal that the student is trying to achieve or topic he wants to learn.

Your job is to predict the plan that the student might be taking in achieving the main goal, or in achieving the immediate next knowledge concept which is a pre-requisite for the main goal. 
Do not give detailed steps that the student is yet to perform, or any results from steps that haven't yet been derived by the student. Give only the rough _phases_ that he plans to go through.
You must also return a code corresponding to the plan.
The code is decided like this:
-1 : It's unclear what the student is doing, or if the student himself is asking for clarification about notation or about a reference to some object that isn't claer from tutor's messages. Essentially, give this code if clarification will help the tutor or the student.
0 : The student is stumped. Either the student explicitely states that he is stumped, or if he asks for answers to very integral parts of the goal (much beyond clarification about symobols and references), such as asking "what is pythagorus' theorem" is a question based around it.
1 : The student's plan is progressing towards the main goal, but doesn't align with the immediate knowledge concept.
2 : The student's plan is progressing towards the immediate knowledge concept.


Example: 

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is remainder of 5 to the power of 107 when divided by 107 ? How would you start on this ?
Student : This question is related to remainders.. so we can apply theorems like Fermart's little theorem. It says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\).. x must be 5 .. but what is p?.
Tutor : Good. Notice that 107 is a prime.

Summary:
1. Student recognises that the problem might involve using number theoretic theorems like Fermart's little theorem. [S1]
2. Fermart's theorem says that \(x^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod p\) [S1].
3. x in Fermart's theorem is 5 in this case [S1].
4. Student doesn't know what is p (in Fermart's theorem) in this case.

Student's next step :
Ok, it should be 1 then.

Possible learning events:
- Extracting information : Notice that 107 is prime
- Variable Setting : Set p = 107 in Fermart's theorem
- Formula Usage : Use Fermart's little theorem incorrectly to say that \(5^{107} \cong 1 \mod 107\)
- Formula Result interpretation : The question asks for remainder, which is 1 (< 107).

Knowledge Concept: Fermart's little theorem

Main goal: Finding remainder of 5 to power of 107 when divided by 107. 
```

A possible plan that the student might be following :

```
1. Fit the numbers to Fermart's little theorem
2. Use the theorem to get information about remainder.
3. Manipulate the congruence from the theorem to get the remainder of 5^107 when divided by 107
```

The code for this will be 2 for this since student's plan is matching with the immediate knowledge concept.

Note how in 3rd step of the predicted plan, we are saying nothing about the _results_ of this manipulation or even the equations and details since those are yet to happen, and not already happened.

Another example:

```
Conversation: 
Tutor : What is the simplified form of (x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1) ?

Student's next step :
We can first expand this as x^2(x^2-x+1) + x(x^2-x+1) + 1(x^2-x+1). 

Possible learning events:
- Extracting information : Notice that the given product expression can be expanded
- Method recall : Recalling the method for expanding products of expressions 
- Method application : Starting to expand the product.

Knowledge Concept: Identity (a-b)(a+b) = a^2 -b^2

Main goal: Simplifying given expression. 
```

A possible plan that the student might be following :

```
1. Expand the given expression by the traditional expansion method.
2. Grouping the terms that will arise from expansion.
```

The code for this will be 1 since the student's plan is a valid way to achieve the main goal, but is not consistent with the immediate knowledge concept that we want to teach.

Format: You must return a code (a number) on the first line and the plan in words on other lines.
